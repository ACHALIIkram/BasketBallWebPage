# Web Application for Managing Club Members - Basketball Club üèÄ

## Project Objective
This web application is designed to simplify the management of members in a basketball club. It allows users to view player profiles, teams, matches, training sessions, and events. Administrators will be able to create, edit, and delete these data.

Visual Inspiration: [Roland-Garros Players](https://www.rolandgarros.com/fr-fr/players/)

## Linters

To ensure readable, consistent, and error-free code, we use various linters tailored to the technologies employed in the project.

### Frontend Linters

- **Prettier**: A code formatter that ensures visual consistency in JavaScript/TypeScript and CSS. It is configured to avoid conflicts with ESLint and to unify the formatting style across the entire project, ensuring uniform code presentation across all frontend files.

### Backend Linters

- **Flake8**: Analyzes Python code to detect syntax errors, logical errors, and style issues, adhering to PEP8 best practices. Flake8 is lightweight, fast, and efficient, providing a solid foundation to ensure code quality and readability, especially in the Python modules of the application.


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the detailed installation instructions in the [installation guide](installation.md).


## Merge Request Process

Before merging any branch into the main branch, every **Merge Request (MR)** must be reviewed by **at least one reviewer**. This process ensures code quality, readability, and adherence to best development practices. Merge Requests without reviewer approval will not be merged.
